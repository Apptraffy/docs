# Step 1. Script Installation.

### 1.1. Obtain the script for your advertising campaign.

If you are the creator of the Buyer (advertising campaign), send the script to your developer via the Traffy application.
You can copy the script from the advertising campaign card.

Example of how the advertising campaign script looks:
```html
<script src="https://dvq1zz1g273yl.cloudfront.net/buyer_v1.0.3.min.js" traffy-key="Your Traffy Key" />
```

### 1.2. Place the script inside the ```<head>``` tag of your ```html``` page.

Paste the copied script inside the ```<head>``` of your ```html``` in the Telegram Miniapp. After this, tasks with subscription to your Miniapp will become "verified". This will increase the task effectiveness.

Example of how it might look:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <script src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js"></script>
    <script src="https://dvq1zz1g273yl.cloudfront.net/buyer_v1.0.3.min.js" traffy-key="Your Traffy Key" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/index.tsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
